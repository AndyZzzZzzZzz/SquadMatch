# SquadMatch

## Description

[//]: <> (The SquadMatch project aims to create an online platform that connects university students through various sports activities. It enables students to find friends and connect based on shared interests in sports, discover mentors for one-on-one tutoring, view local competitions, and form groups for games. We identified a common issue among our peers - many enjoy sports like badminton and basketball but struggle to find peers to play with. Since no existing platform addresses this need, SquadMatch offers a perfect solution.)

Do you love sports but find it tough to track down someone to play with? You're not alone! That’s where SquadMatch steps in. We’re building an online space that not only helps you find teammates but also connects you with others who share your passion for sports. Whether you’re seeking casual games, local tournaments, or even a mentor for one-on-one training, SquadMatch has you covered. Say goodbye to endless social media searches or awkward inquiries. We’ve spotted the need, and we’re here to bring you fun, friendships, and plenty of action-packed sports!
